# drawGraph
Draws graphs using Python's matplotlib library

# Requirements
In order to use it you need to have Python 3 with `matplotlib` and `numpy` installed.

# Usage
The idea is that you give the script a mathematical function, f(x), and it will draw a graph for it. In this particular program, the supplied function's syntax should be valid Python syntax. So for example, to draw a graph of xÂ² you would have to write x**2, rather than something like x^2.

`drawGraph.py` simply contains the basic functions needed to draw graphs, `drawGraph2.py` can be used from the command-line and `drawGraphGUI.py` uses tkinter to invoke a GUI from which you can draw graphs.
